Setup instructions for a new tipping game

1. Setup the configuration
In the config folder rename config_template.php to config.php and adjust the following settings: 
- Database connection credentials
- Startdate of the matches
- Scores for the tipps
- If required a time shift.

2. Create the logfiles at the location which is mentioned in the config.php file. Normally, this is log/exceptions.log and log/debug.log, if debugging should be enabled.

3. Create a layout
As a starting point an example layout can be copied from it's subfolder to the layout directory.

4. Enter the fields in setup/data.php. 
These data are automatically written to the database on startup: List of countries, description of the match days and admin users that are created as default.

5. Now visit URL setup/setup_new_game.php to start the setup wizard.
